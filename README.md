# StrEatFoodie
The best and only [SoMaStrEatFood Park](http://somastreatfoodpark.com/) menubar app.

StrEatFoodie listens to SoMa StrEatFood's Twitter feed, finds the tweets that announce which trucks will
be at the park for lunch and dinner, and displays those trucks in a menubar popup.

StrEatFoodie uses these open source projects:

- [TweetPoller](https://github.com/jimmyoneill/TweetPoller)
- [Popup](https://github.com/shpakovski/Popup)
- [NSString+Levenshtein](https://github.com/aufflick/aufflick-cocoa-additions/tree/master/Cocoa%20Additions/NSString+Levenshtein)
